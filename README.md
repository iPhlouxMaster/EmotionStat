# EmotionStat
EmotionStat is a backend application which grabs the data from your circle of friends on Facebook and measures how much each one of your friends feels happy or sad according to their type of posts and their content.

It is powered by my library ScrapBook (https://github.com/miguelangelo78/ScrapBook).
